# Google Analytics for Single Pags Apps

DO NOT USE THIS YET!!!!!. Still working on it.

When complete, I will use this to house some helper functions to track specific interactions, durations, pageViews etc. W/0 relying on the clumsy GA code snippets the analytics panel provides.
Currently GA does not hang well with SPA's as it will not get a new pageView event when navigating internally or with pushState.
